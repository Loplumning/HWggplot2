`mpg` is the dataset that comes with ggplot.  You can use `View(mpg)` to get an overview of the dataset. 

1. Using the `mpg` dataset generate a scatter plot of `cty` (city mileage) and `hwy` (highway mileage).


2. Add a colour scale to the scatterplot based on the `displ` variable (engine displacement in liters).


3. Using the `mpg` dataset recreate the plot as shown below.


4. Split the `cty` vs hwy plot into a grid of plots separated by `drv`. 


5. Generate a boxplot of `cty` comparing `drv` (f=front wheel, r=rear wheel, 4=4 wheel).


6. Generate density plots of `hwy` coloured by `drv`.  


7. Generate a boxplot of `cty` comparing type of transmission (automatic v.s. manual)
